    <h2>Mongodb</h2>
    <p>MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database
       program.</p>
    <p> Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents
        with schemata. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc., and is published under
       a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>Node.js</h2>
    <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes 
      JavaScript code outside the browser.</p> 
    <p> Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for 
      client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's
       HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <h2>Express</h2>
    <p>The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers,.</p>
    <p>making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.
      Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. 
      With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your 
      perfect framework.</p>
